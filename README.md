# tunneler-client
iOS and Apple Watch companion app for tunneler-server

# Description

This app is a part of the designed experiments I typically work on for myself during my free time. I use it to open up a connection to my server at home so that my iPad Pro (or any other device) can become an immediate development support even if I do not have my computer with me. I've created the mockup based on [@daramghaus's template](https://dribbble.com/shots/2015674-iPhone-6-Mockup-AI) and have put in some of the screenshots to give you a sense of what it looks like.

# Installation

The only additional setup required is to install Carthage and run `carthage update`. Then, you can simply build and run!
